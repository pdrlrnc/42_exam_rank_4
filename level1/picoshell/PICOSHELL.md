**Assignment name:** `picoshell`

**Expected files:** `picoshell.c`

**Allowed functions:** `close`, `fork`, `wait`, `exit`, `execvp`, `dup2`, `pipe`

---

Write the following function:
```c
int picoshell(char **cmds[]);
```

The goal of this function is to execute a pipeline. It must execute each command of `cmds` and connect the output of one to the input of the next command (just like a shell).

- `cmds` contains a null-terminated list of valid commands.
- Each row of `cmds` is an `argv` array directly usable for a call to `execvp`.
- The first argument of each command is the command name or path and can be passed directly as the first argument of `execvp`.
- If any error occurs, the function must return `1` (you must of course close all the open fds before).
- Otherwise the function must wait for all child processes and return `0`.
- You will find in this directory a file `main.c` which contains something to help you test your function.

## Examples
```sh
$> ./picoshell /bin/ls "|" /usr/bin/grep picoshell
picoshell

$> ./picoshell echo 'squalala' "|" cat "|" sed 's/a/b/g'
squblblb
```
